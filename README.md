# ReactNativeRdpAnmeldung
Sharing my first react native project based on a school-based React project.
_This app is created for educational purposes only and has no real use except for providing a neat way to get familiar with the way React Native works._

## Brief introduction
This is just an entry-level project for learning React Native. It is similar to a Todo-List as Items can be added/removed of a `FlatList`. 
The data is persisted without encryption to the local storage by using the AsyncStorage-Community-Repository.

## Getting started
If you are using npm, you can run the following commands if you have set up React Native correctly with a virtual Android-Device: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

```bash
npm install
npx react-native start
npx react-native run-android #(in a separate Terminal)
```
**Remark: It is very likely that Expo won't work as the React-Native-CLI was used directly!**
